# Starknet-Library

Hello everyone, I am Implementing a Starknet based library. The goal is two have two types of participants i.e Administrators and Learners.

The participant signs in as one of the two in order to access the library. For both the users, A list of all the books is displayed in alphabetical order when they log in. They both are able to search whether a certain book exists in the catalogue of books or not.

The admins further have the rights to add or delete a book.
