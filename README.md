# Starknet-Library

Hello everyone, I am Implementing a Starknet based library. The goal is two have two types of participants i.e Administrators and Learners.

The participant signs in as one of the two in order to access the library. Upon signing in, a list of all the books is displayed in alphabetical order.

The Learners have the following permissions:

1. Display Books

2. Search for a book


The admins have the following permissions:-

1. Display Books.

2. Search for a book.

3. Add a book.

4. Delete a book.

Challenge::The library should employ a contract which should self reorganize to allow for an efficient search.


N/B The capability of each user can change in future upon need
